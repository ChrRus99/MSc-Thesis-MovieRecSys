# Resolving CUDA Initialization Issues in Apache Airflow: Handling Forked Processes and GPU Contexts

<br>

---

## Chapter 1: Problem and Solution Overview

### Problem

In an Apache Airflow environment, GPU-dependent tasks (such as initializing CUDA and running PyTorch operations) may fail with the following error:

> "CUDA error: initialization error. Compile with `TORCH_USE_CUDA_DSA` to enable device-side assertions."

This error occurs because Airflow‚Äôs default process creation method (`fork`) causes child processes to inherit an already-initialized CUDA state from the parent process. This leads to a corrupted or inconsistent CUDA context in the child processes, resulting in failures during CUDA initialization.

### Wrong Approach

The following approach demonstrates an incorrect way of handling CUDA in an Airflow DAG. Here, the CUDA-dependent operations are executed directly within the Airflow task, leading to potential issues with forked processes inheriting a corrupted CUDA state.

`Airflow DAG`
```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

import os
import torch
import subprocess
import logging

def debug_cuda():
  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
  logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

  # Check nvidia-smi
  logger.info("üîç Checking nvidia-smi output...")
  try:
    nvidia_smi_output = subprocess.check_output(["nvidia-smi"], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT).decode()
    logger.info(f"nvidia-smi Output:\n{nvidia_smi_output}")
  except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    logger.error(f"Error running nvidia-smi: {e.output.decode()}")

  # Check CUDA availability
  logger.info("üîç Checking PyTorch CUDA availability...")
  cuda_available = torch.cuda.is_available()
  logger.info(f"CUDA Available: {cuda_available}")

  if cuda_available:
    try:
      logger.info("üîç Running a small CUDA tensor operation test...")
      test_tensor = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], device="cuda") * 2
      logger.info(f"CUDA Tensor Computation Success: {test_tensor}")
    except Exception as e:
      logger.error(f"Error during CUDA tensor operation: {e}")

# Define the Airflow DAG
with DAG(
    dag_id="cuda_debug_wrong",
    default_args={
        "owner": "airflow",
        "start_date": datetime(2024, 1, 1),
        "retries": 1,
        "retry_delay": timedelta(minutes=5),
    },
    schedule_interval=None,
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    debug_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id="debug_cuda",
        python_callable=debug_cuda,
    )
```
This approach fails because Airflow forks processes for task execution, leading to CUDA initialization issues. To resolve this, we use a subprocess to run CUDA-dependent operations in an isolated process.


### Solution

To resolve this issue, the solution is to move the CUDA-dependent code into a separate Python script and execute it using the `subprocess` module. This approach ensures that the CUDA context is initialized in a fresh process (using the spawn method), thereby directly addressing the root problem described above, while avoiding issues related to forked processes and daemonic process limitations.

### Correct Approach

The correct approach involves moving CUDA-dependent operations to a separate script and executing it using subprocess to ensure a fresh process is used for CUDA initialization.

`Airflow DAG`
```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import subprocess
import logging

def debug_cuda():
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    logger = logging.getLogger("debug_cuda")
    try:
        script_path = "/opt/airflow/dags/debug_cuda_inner.py"
        logger.info(f"Running debug script: {script_path}")
        subprocess.check_call(["python", script_path])
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        logger.error(f"Error during debug subprocess: {e.output.decode()}")

# Define the Airflow DAG
with DAG(
    dag_id="cuda_debug_correct",
    default_args={
        "owner": "airflow",
        "start_date": datetime(2024, 1, 1),
        "retries": 1,
        "retry_delay": timedelta(minutes=5),
    },
    schedule_interval=None,
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    debug_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id="debug_cuda",
        python_callable=debug_cuda,
    )
```

`debug_cuda_inner.py`
```python
import os
import torch
import subprocess
import logging

def debug_cuda():
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    # Check nvidia-smi
    logger.info("üîç Checking nvidia-smi output...")
    try:
        nvidia_smi_output = subprocess.check_output(["nvidia-smi"], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT).decode()
        logger.info(f"nvidia-smi Output:\n{nvidia_smi_output}")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        logger.error(f"Error running nvidia-smi: {e.output.decode()}")

    # Check CUDA availability
    logger.info("üîç Checking PyTorch CUDA availability...")
    cuda_available = torch.cuda.is_available()
    logger.info(f"CUDA Available: {cuda_available}")

    if cuda_available:
        try:
            logger.info("üîç Running a small CUDA tensor operation test...")
            test_tensor = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], device="cuda") * 2
            logger.info(f"CUDA Tensor Computation Success: {test_tensor}")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error during CUDA tensor operation: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    debug_cuda()
```
Here, `debug_cuda_inner.py` contains CUDA-dependent logic, which runs in a separate process. This avoids CUDA initialization issues caused by Airflow‚Äôs process forking behavior.

## Chapter 2: Why the Subprocess Approach Works for CUDA Initialization in Airflow

Building on the central issue outlined in Chapter 1, this chapter explains why the subprocess approach is the effective remedy.

### 1. Airflow and Process Forking

- **Forking in Airflow:**  
  Airflow‚Äôs task execution often uses the LocalExecutor (or similar executors) which create child processes using the `fork()` system call. This causes the child to inherit the entire memory space of the parent process, including the already-initialized CUDA context.

- **Fork-Related Issues with CUDA:**  
  CUDA libraries and drivers are not designed for this inheritance. If a process that has already initialized CUDA is forked, the child may end up with a corrupted or partially-initialized CUDA state. This directly underpins the error described in Chapter 1.

### 2. The Subprocess Approach

- **Spawning a New Process:**  
  By relocating the CUDA-dependent code into a separate Python script and using the `subprocess` module, a completely new process is spawned using the spawn method. This avoids the pitfalls of forked processes, ensuring that the fresh process does not inherit any unwanted state.

- **Fresh Process Initialization:**  
  A newly spawned process starts with a clean memory slate, allowing CUDA to be initialized correctly from scratch. This is the key factor in addressing the issue raised in Chapter 1.

- **Avoiding Daemonic Process Limitations:**  
  In forked environments like in Airflow, daemonic processes cannot spawn new child processes. By launching a separate script using `subprocess`, we circumvent this limitation since the subprocess is a completely independent process.

### 3. Benefits of This Approach

- **Isolation of CUDA Initialization:**  
  Isolating CUDA logic in a separate process guarantees that the CUDA context is established in a fresh environment, free from any interference from a parent process‚Äôs state.

- **Improved Stability:**  
  Initializing CUDA in a spawned process enhances the stability of GPU operations, which is critical for distributed systems like Airflow where multiple tasks run concurrently.

- **Easier Debugging and Logging:**  
  Isolated execution simplifies error logging and debugging by capturing detailed output in the subprocess. The subprocess outputs its logs to stdout/stderr, which Airflow captures in the task logs, providing clear insights into the CUDA environment.

## NOT WORKING METHOD!!!
## Chapter 3: Implementing CUDA Initialization with Explicit Spawn Method in Apache Airflow

This chapter provides a direct, practical demonstration of how to address CUDA initialization issues in Apache Airflow by explicitly setting the multiprocessing start method to 'spawn'. Building upon the foundational problem and solution concepts discussed in Chapters 1 and 2, this chapter focuses on a code-centric, immediately applicable approach.

### Problem Revisited: CUDA and Forking Conflicts

As established in earlier chapters, Airflow's default process forking behavior can lead to corrupted CUDA contexts in child processes, resulting in errors like:

> RuntimeError: Cannot re-initialize CUDA in forked subprocess. To use CUDA with multiprocessing, you must use the 'spawn' start method

or

> AssertionError: daemonic processes are not allowed to have children

These errors highlight the fundamental conflict between CUDA's initialization requirements and Airflow's process management.

### Solution: Explicitly Setting the 'spawn' Multiprocessing Method

Instead of relying on subprocesses, this chapter demonstrates how to directly configure the multiprocessing start method to 'spawn' within an Airflow task. This ensures that new processes are created with a fresh, uncorrupted CUDA context.

**Key Concept:** By setting `torch.multiprocessing.set_start_method('spawn', force=True)`, we override the default 'fork' behavior, forcing PyTorch and CUDA to initialize in a clean environment.

### Example Airflow DAG Implementation

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import torch.multiprocessing as mp
import torch

def set_spawn_method():
    """Sets the multiprocessing start method to 'spawn'."""
    mp.set_start_method('spawn', force=True)

def cuda_task():
    """Executes a CUDA operation after ensuring the 'spawn' method is set."""
    set_spawn_method()

    # Example CUDA operation
    device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
    tensor = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], device=device)
    print(f'Tensor on {device}: {tensor}')

default_args = {
    'owner': 'airflow',
    'depends_on_past': False,
    'start_date': datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    'retries': 1,
    'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5),
}

with DAG(
    'cuda_example_dag_spawn',
    default_args=default_args,
    description='Demonstrates CUDA operations with explicit spawn method in Airflow.',
    schedule_interval=timedelta(days=1),
) as dag:
    run_cuda_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='run_cuda_task',
        python_callable=cuda_task,
    )
```

### Explanation

- **`set_spawn_method()`:** This function explicitly sets the multiprocessing start method to 'spawn', ensuring that all subsequent processes follow this behavior. The `force=True` argument overrides any previously set method.
- **`cuda_task()`:** This function first calls `set_spawn_method()` to guarantee the 'spawn' method is active. It then proceeds with a simple CUDA operation, demonstrating that CUDA can be initialized successfully.

### Why This Approach?

1. **Direct Control:** This method provides direct control over the multiprocessing start method, eliminating the need for external scripts or subprocesses.
2. **Simplicity:** It simplifies the code by consolidating the solution within the Airflow task itself.
3. **Clarity:** It clearly demonstrates the importance of the 'spawn' method in resolving CUDA initialization issues.
